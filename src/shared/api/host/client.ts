/**
 * PAPI client cache shared by every product that talks to a Polkadot
 * chain through `polkadot-api`.
 *
 * Provider strategy:
 *
 *   - **In host** (Polkadot Desktop webview, dotli iframe, native mobile):
 *     `createPapiProvider(genesis, wsFallbackProvider)` from
 *     `@novasamatech/host-api-wrapper`. The SDK probes the host with
 *     `host_feature_supported(Chain, genesis)`. When the host advertises the
 *     chain, all JSON-RPC flows through the host bridge — required on mobile,
 *     where the sandboxed iframe cannot open arbitrary WSS sockets. When the
 *     host does NOT advertise the chain, the SDK falls through to the WS
 *     provider passed as the 2nd argument instead of returning a dead provider
 *     that silently hangs every send.
 *
 *   - **Standalone** (regular browser tab):
 *     Direct WSS to `wsFallback`. `createPapiProvider` throws outside a host
 *     product environment (`isCorrectEnvironment()` is false), so it is never
 *     called here — the `!inHost()` guard picks the WS provider directly.
 *
 * Why a host-detection predicate is passed in:
 *
 *   `getOrCreateClient` is environment-aware, but the predicate is
 *   provided by the caller (each app's local `host-connection.ts`)
 *   rather than imported from `./connection.ts`. This keeps the cache
 *   module mockable — tests can pass a stubbed predicate without
 *   reaching into shared-package internals.
 *
 * Why a single map keyed by genesis:
 *
 *   One PAPI client per genesis hash. Prevents in-flight chainHead events
 *   from a destroyed client corrupting a new client's block tree. Mirrors
 *   the pattern in `w3s-conference-app/packages/shared/host/client.ts`.

/**
 * Get or create a PAPI client for a given chain genesis hash. Subsequent
 * calls with the same genesis return the cached client.
 *
 * Transport:
 *   - `"auto"` (default): host mode routes through `createPapiProvider` with
 *     the WS provider passed as its fallback, so a chain the host does not
 *     advertise degrades to direct WS instead of a dead provider; standalone
 *     mode opens a direct WS to `wsFallback` (createPapiProvider throws outside
 *     a host product environment, so it cannot be called there).
 *   - `"ws"`: ALWAYS open a direct WS to `wsFallback`, even in host. Use this
 *     for chains where the host's `createPapiProvider` advertises support but
 *     does not establish a working chainHead follow — on Paseo Asset Hub Next
 *     that makes `signSubmitAndWatch` broadcast (the tx lands) yet never emit
 *     `txBestBlocksState`, so the write hangs at "broadcasting". Signing still
 *     goes through the host product-account signer; only chain RPC bypasses
 *     the host. (This is exactly what the working t3rminal app does for this
 *     chain — see `apps/t3rminal-v1/lib/host/provider.ts`.) NOTE: a `"ws"`
 *     client cannot run inside a mobile sandbox that blocks WSS.
