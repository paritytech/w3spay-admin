/**
 * Host permission React surface.
 *
 * `useCameraPermission` probes the host's camera-permission grant once at
 * mount and exposes a stable `state` plus a `retry()` for "camera needed"
 * screens. Moved here from the w3spay app so any product that scans
 * inside a Polkadot host shares one implementation.
 *
 * Why probe at boot (rather than lazily inside the scanner):
 *   - On dot.li the iframe's `allow="camera"` attribute is only set after
 *     the user accepts the host modal. Probing at boot fires the modal
 *     before the scanning chrome ever renders, so a previously-denied
 *     grant never produces a "scanning UI → bounce to needs-camera" flash.
 *   - It centralises permission state in one hook the routing layer can
 *     branch on declaratively.
 *
 * Sequencing: dot.li shows only one host permission modal at a time, so
 * the caller passes `enabled` to defer the probe until prior modals (e.g.
 * a balance modal) have closed. While `enabled === false` the state stays
 * `pending`.
 * Host-readiness gate: the probe also waits for `useHostWalletSnapshot().isReady`
 * — the camera modal must not fire before the auto-initing store's
 * handshake completes.
