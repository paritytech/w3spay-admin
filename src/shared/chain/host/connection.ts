/**
 * Host detection + AccountsProvider singleton.
 *
 * Shared between w3spay and w3spay-admin (and any future product
 * that runs inside a Polkadot host: Desktop webview, mobile/dotli
 * iframe, or standalone). Each app re-exports these helpers from
 * its local `host-connection.ts` and layers app-specific concerns
 * (connection caching, demo-mode, feature flags) on top — see each
 * app's own `src/.../host-connection.ts`.
 *
 * Authentication itself is NOT driven from product code — dotli's
 * topbar owns the QR-login modal (RFC 0009), and Polkadot Desktop
 * drives login through its own UI. Products `subscribeAccountConnectionStatus`
 * and react when the host flips to `"connected"`.
 *
 * ─── Async handshake ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The `isSandboxReady()` snapshot is **not** enough on iOS mobile hosts:
 * the `MessagePort` that the SDK talks over is published by the webview
 * shell AFTER the iframe mounts, and the latency between the two can
 * exceed the time it takes React to fire the first effect. Calling any
 * host request (subscribe, getProductAccount) before the port is up
 * races the SDK's lazy `isReady()` and surfaces as
 * `RequestCredentialsErr::Unknown` with reason `"Polkadot host is not
 * ready"`. w3s-conference-app's `injectSpektrExtension()` does the
 * exact same `sandboxTransport.isReady()` wait under a different name
 * — that single gate is what makes its mobile flow work while ours
 * hung on the boot splash.
 *
 * `connectToHost()` exposes that wait as an awaited, cached, timed
 * helper. Both apps call it at boot before any direct host request,
 * with the iOS gate (`injectHostWallet()`) running first so a mobile
 * host that responds to the postMessage-based handshake only after the
 * Spektr extension has been bridged is no longer raced out by the 15s
 * budget firing first.
